# Allows access to the static files that provide the dump1090 map view,
# and also to the dynamically-generated json parts that contain aircraft
# data and are periodically written by the dump1090 daemon.

# Enable alias module
#
## This module is normally already enabled in lighttpd, so you should not
## need to uncommment this line.
## There are some cases (e.g. when installing this on a Raspberry Pi
## that runs PiHole) in which the module has been removed from the
## default configuration, and the dump1090-fa web interface no longer
## loads properly.
## If this is what you are experiencing, or if you see messages in your
## error log like:
## (server.c.1493) WARNING: unknown config-key: alias.url (ignored)
## then uncommenting this line and then restarting lighttpd could fix
## the issue.
## This is not enabled by default as standard lighttpd will not start if
## modules are loaded multiple times.
